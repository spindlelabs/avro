Biff Labs Avro
==============

This fork exists primarily as a development repository for Avro Objective-C work. All work is done on the `develop` branch for reasons we won't get into. Sorry.

Current develop branch status
----------------------------------------
The `develop` branch is currently in a weird state. It *should* be at Apache Avro's release-1.6.3 tag, but it's currently in a hybrid state somewhere beyond release-1.6.3. It is *at least* at release-1.6.3. We currently don't have a need to clean this up, so we'll hopefully just let the releases catch up to our `develop` branch, and with time, the problem will correct itself.
